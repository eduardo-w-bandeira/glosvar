 *Glossary of Variable Abbreviations in Python and Alternatives for Protected Names*


## Rules
Abbreviations should:
1. Whenever possible, be pronounceable as standalone words, rather than requiring the spelling of each letter.
2. Be used only for words with 5 or more letters.
3. Refer only to a single word, or at most, to words with the same root.
4. Whenever possible, not form an existing known word.
5. Not form a Python reserved word or a built-in function.
